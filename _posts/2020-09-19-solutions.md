    <a href="https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.pilot">RADICAL-Pilot:</a> Pilot-enabled runtime system for executing many-task workloads on high-performance computing platforms. Specifically designed for scale, performance and efficiency, RADICAL-Pilot can concurrently launch single/multi-core/GPU MPI/OpenMP executables and Python function calls. Scales on 4000+ compute nodes with minimal overheads and resource utilization as high as 98%. Implemented in Python to enable rapid adoption and extreme customization.</p>

    <a href="https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.saga">RADICAL-SAGA:</a> OGF standard-based application program interface to enable seamless interoperability among batch management system. Access SLURM, LSF, Torque, PBS-pro and many other batch systems via a unified interface. Programmatically submit jobs, managing their data dependences. Implemented in Python to enable rapid adoption and extreme customization.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-character margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-top: 1.25em;">
    <a href="https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.entk">RADICAL-EnTK:</a> Workflow manager and engine, specifically designed to implement the ensemble abstraction. Allows to describe workflows as one or more pipelines with few lines of Python code. Abstracts  resource provisioning and management away from the user, exposing an application program interface based just on Python lists and sets. Supports adaptive executions and complex task coordination patterns, including pausing and resuming pipelines.</p>
